 This is my blog that means nothing really.  It was started as a development
project so I can gain a greater understanding of Ruby programming.  At my day
job I  am, among many IT Administrative roles,  the Director of web development.
I was hired in December 2013 and inherited a thriving and robust Ruby on
Rails application in the form of an employee and student web portal at a
University. Using Jekyll for this blog gives me another environment to play around
with a Ruby Gem.
