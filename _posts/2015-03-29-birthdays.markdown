  I was born on July 1st.  I thought it was really cool when my first son, Drew
   arrived, he was born on July 7th, only 6 days after my birthday.  Then Robby
   came along and I didn't think much of it, but he was born on July 6th, 5 days
   after my birthday. It was cool having their birthdays close to mine, and in that order,
   but what if we had another child? We found out in 2012 actually.  For Jenna to follow
   that trend she would have to be born either 7 or 4 days after my birthday.  
   It just didn't seem possible she could  follow suit.  She was scheduled to
   arrive  in April so it was impossible. However, Jenna ended up following that
   convention anyway,  I just wasn't thinking the right way. Because you see,  
   she was born on April 5th , 7 days after my wife Jennifer's birthday, March
   29th. Duh!  Happy Birthday!
